        <h2>Personal information</h2>
        <p>My name is Lewie Zhu. As you can see from my chosen picture. I really like pikachu and it was drawn by a
          close friend of mine. I was born here in the Netherlands in a city called Nijmegen. Although im born in the
          netherlands my whole family came from China. So i was born in a asian household. This year started my first
          year at the Hz in Middelburg.
          Before starting this study i had zero experience in programming but im really eager to learn and hopefully
          improve as much as possible during my study here. Im not really talkative and quite introverted.

        </p>
