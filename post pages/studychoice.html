            <h2>Study choice activities</h2>
                <p>I looked up available studies in fields that i where interested  through the internet. Made a list of them and thought about the things i dislike and like about them. For some of the studies i went to a open day to find out more about the study and school environment.

            <h2>Study motivation</h2>
                <p>From looking through the studies I really liked how the curriculum of this study is setup because the first two years will give a good orientation of the three directions. By going through multiple courses involved with all three directions. My motivation to go through this study is find out how computer works or how people interact with them to be able to either create solutions or find problems for people with the assistence of ICT. The feeling of learning new things and being apply them in helping other with solutions or formulate their problems will give me accomplished feeling.

            <h2>After completing the study</h2>
                <p>After graduating i'm hoping being able to apply all the knowledge obstained during my study in the ICT world. I am interested in being a software developer or business IT consultant. Being able to create solutions and adding value to solutions sound really nice to me. Otherwise just being the bridge that connects the problems and solution sounds nice to me too. I am hoping to learn the right mindset and skills to be able to confidently approach problems with solutions. Also being able to find what direction would fit me more during these coming two years of studying at the HZ.
