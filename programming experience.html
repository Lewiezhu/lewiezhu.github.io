          Like this post my programming experience is really low. Before i started with this study, I had zero experience in programming. Started with doing the recommended
          three courses in the SKC questionnaire and it was quite interesting to follow and comprehend. After doing the programming basics so far i have learned quite alot. I still need to keep practising to master these basics so far.
